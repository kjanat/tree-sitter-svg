## Build & Tooling

- `tree-sitter.json` should declare `highlights`, `injections`, and `locals` query paths in the grammar entry; omitting them triggers a CLI warning and may prevent editors from finding the queries
- External scanner enum order must exactly match `externals` order in `grammar.js`; mismatches silently corrupt tokenization
- For simple external tokens (tag names, `/>`), avoid `mark_end` unless doing lookahead rollback; premature `mark_end` can truncate tokens
- `tree-sitter build --wasm` can look stuck at `Extracting wasi-sdk...`, but for this grammar the real stall is later in wasm backend codegen for `src/parser.c`; syntax-only and LLVM IR emission finish quickly, object/wasm emission does not
- WASM build fails when parser.c exceeds ~100K lines; at 102K lines (458 rules, 50 externals) the WASM backend cannot complete; at 21K lines (120 rules, 13 externals) it succeeds instantly
- Zed's extension builder uses wasi-sdk clang-19 to compile grammar WASM; 102K-line parser.c hung indefinitely (23GB RSS); 21K-line parser.c compiles in ~17s
- Scanner stores tag names as `Array(char)`, truncating `int32_t` lookahead to 8 bits; safe for SVG (ASCII-only names), matches tree-sitter-xml/html; widening to `Array(int32_t)` would require serialization format change
- Serialization silently truncates tag stack when 1024-byte buffer exceeded; `written` count is patched to reflect actual serialized tags
- `tree-sitter build --reuse-allocator` fails for any grammar whose scanner uses `tree_sitter/array.h` — the CLI passes `-DTREE_SITTER_REUSE_ALLOCATOR` (mapping `ts_malloc` → `ts_current_malloc`) but doesn't link the runtime that defines those symbols; confirmed broken on tree-sitter-rust too (not our bug)
- Scanner should use `ts_calloc`/`ts_free` (from `alloc.h` via `array.h`) instead of raw `calloc`/`free` so allocator routing works when the CLI eventually fixes `--reuse-allocator`

## Grammar

- `prec.left` on path segment rules causes the parser to exit after the first argument instead of continuing the repeat; subsequent values become `implicit_lineto_segment` nodes. For coordinate-pair-based segments (lineto, curveto, etc.) this is structurally harmless but semantically wrong. For arc segments (7-value arguments, odd count), the leftover produces ERROR nodes. Fix: external scanner `_arc_continuation` peeks past whitespace to verify a number follows before entering the arc repeat — gives LR(k) lookahead for an inherently LR(2) conflict.
- Keeping `extras` empty preserves XML whitespace as explicit `text` nodes (including indentation/newlines)
- Generic XML attributes should require quoted values; allowing valueless/unquoted attrs accepts non-XML SVG
- Tag-name matching needs an external scanner stack; CFG-only grammar cannot enforce `<a>...</a>` equality
- Using hidden pre/post-root rules keeps document-structure helpers out of the visible CST
- For context-specific attributes (e.g. `type` on `<script>`/`<style>`), avoid including `generic_attribute` in the same element-specific attribute list or strict typing is bypassed
- To enforce content models for selected elements, add name-specialized externals + hidden element subrules (e.g. `_path_element`) instead of broad generic children
- Category overlap in scanner name predicates is precedence-sensitive (e.g. if an element name belongs to two families, first matching branch wins)
- Tight `defs` content models surface omitted common definition elements quickly (e.g. `clipPath`); either add explicit families or expect recovery nodes
- Using `$.attribute` (typed + generic) on specialized container tags restores extension/custom attribute support without weakening the global XML quoting constraint
- Filter primitive conformance needs family-scoped tag tokens and rules (`feColorMatrix`, `feTurbulence`, `feComponentTransfer` + `feFunc*`, `feMerge` + `feMergeNode`, lighting + light-source) rather than one shared primitive bucket
- `text` content should include linking/media (`<a>`) to accept common inline link patterns (`<text><a><tspan>…`)
- Zed's `jsx_tag_auto_close` matches exact grammar node names for open/close tags; if the SVG root uses distinct tag node kinds from nested elements, root auto-close fails even when the visible CST looks equivalent

## Testing

- `:error` corpus sections are best for invalid syntax checks; for recovery-node checks without parser error state, keep normal sections with expected trees
- Add dedicated path-data corpus cases for implicit separators and arc-flag adjacency (e.g. `A... 01 ...`) to prevent regressions
- Highlight tests for XML-based grammars use `<!-- -->` comments for assertions; `<!--` occupies cols 0-3 so `^` carets can only target col 4+; use indented arrow tests (`<!-- <- capture -->`) to reach earlier columns
- In highlight tests, child literal captures (`"<?"`, `"<!--"`, `"<!DOCTYPE"` → `@punctuation.delimiter`) override parent node captures (`(xml_declaration) @keyword`, `(comment) @comment`); test the inner text, not the delimiter, for the parent's highlight
- Tag test assertion comments (`<!-- ^ definition.id -->`) are real comment nodes in the CST; if an assertion comment appears right before another id-bearing element, it becomes that element's `@doc` docstring. Insert a non-id element between them to break the adjacency chain

## Tags (code navigation)

- `tree-sitter tags` only allows capture names `@definition.*`, `@reference.*`, `@doc`, `@name`, `@local.*`; any other capture (e.g. `@_name` for predicate filtering) causes `Invalid capture` error and no output at all
- In `tree-sitter tags`, when multiple patterns match the same `@name`/`@definition.*` node, the first matching pattern wins; doc-bearing patterns must precede simpler fallback patterns or the docstring is lost
- With `extras: () => []`, explicit `(text)` whitespace nodes appear between sibling comments and elements; the `.` anchor requires consecutive named siblings, so use `(comment) . (text) . (element)` to bridge. Also need a variant without `(text)` for inline placement (`<!-- doc --><el/>`)
- Query child patterns match direct children only, not descendants; `(element (self_closing_tag (id_attribute ...)))` is "Impossible pattern" because `attribute` wraps `id_attribute` — must write `(element (self_closing_tag (attribute (id_attribute ...))))`
- SVG IDs are document-global; `@local.scope` should be on `svg_root_element` only, not per-element — a `<linearGradient id="grad1">` inside `<defs>` must be referenceable from anywhere

## Bindings

- Bun cannot load Node-API `.node` addons via `import()`; use `require()` (or `process.dlopen`) for Bun-specific loading paths
- `bun test` works in this repo when expected prebuild paths exist; test bootstrap can create the missing `tree-sitter` runtime prebuild path under `node_modules/tree-sitter/prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>/`

## SVG Spec Gotchas

- SVG 2 `svg_path` grammar allows empty/whitespace-only `d` values; treat `d=""` and `d="   "` as valid parse cases
- `svg` root detection should accept namespaced forms like `svg:svg` by checking local-name segment after the last `:`

## Tree-sitter Quirks

- `<?xml` can be lexically stolen by generic `<?` processing-instruction rules; `token(prec(..., '<?xml'))` fixes declaration recognition
- `tree-sitter` v0.25.0 native addon fails to compile with newer Node/V8 toolchains in this repo setup; Node 22 LTS works — Volta pin set to 22.22.1
- Non-start grammar rules cannot match empty strings; wrap optional emptiness in parent rules instead of making the child nullable
- Overlapping whitespace tokens (e.g. `misc_text` vs path whitespace) can cause wrong token choice; assign precedence for context-specific whitespace tokens
- `tree-sitter test -u` will not update sections that still parse with `ERROR`/`MISSING`; fix grammar/input first, then rerun update
- If one rule is a strict superset of another (e.g. `length` includes bare numbers), avoid including both in the same `choice` without precedence; this creates unresolved LR conflicts
- Aliasing a named subrule to `$.element` inside the `element` rule can create nested `(element (element ...))`; use hidden subrules (`_foo_element`) to keep CST stable
- With many specialized externals, choose token symbol *after* scanning the full name against all valid symbols; pairwise ambiguity guards do not scale

## Architecture: Parse Structure Not Schema

- Encoding SVG element categories × attribute combinations in the grammar causes LR state explosion (458 rules → 102K-line parser.c); collapsing to 5 element types + 14 typed attributes → 120 rules, 21K-line parser.c (79% reduction)
- Content model constraints (e.g. "path cannot contain child elements") belong in linting/query layers, not the parser; grammar should accept structurally valid XML
- `raw_text` external token for script/style must guard against error recovery: when tree-sitter sets all `valid_symbols` true, check `!valid_symbols[START_TAG_NAME] && !valid_symbols[END_TAG_NAME]` to prevent raw_text from consuming normal content
- Only 5 element names need scanner recognition: svg (root enforcement), path (d attribute), script/style (raw text capture), plus generic fallback
- Attribute sub-grammars worth keeping in the parser are those with genuine value syntax (path data, viewBox numbers, transform functions, paint functions, URI references) — keyword-only attributes (calcMode, spreadMethod, edgeMode) belong in queries
- CDATA text cannot be tokenized correctly with a pure regex when content contains `]` before `]]>` (e.g. `a]]]>`); the regex `\]\][^>]` over-matches runs of 3+ `]`. External scanner + `repeat1()` chunking is required (same approach as tree-sitter-xml)
- When a tree-sitter external scanner returns false, the lexer position resets to the scan start — advance() calls are undone. This enables peek-ahead patterns: advance past potential delimiters, return false if found (letting the grammar match the literal), return true with mark_end if not

## 2026-03-22: Helix 25.07.1 rejects `#strip!` in SVG queries

Helix logged `Failed to compile highlights for 'svg': unknown predicate #strip!` even though
the predicate only appeared in `queries/tags.scm` and `queries/locals.scm`.

Practical consequence:

- SVG buffers could show no Tree-sitter syntax highlighting at all when Helix loaded the query set.

Workaround used here:

- remove `#strip!` from the SVG Helix query set and keep only the `#match? "^#"` guards

Tradeoff:

- tag/locals references that rely on stripping the leading `#` may no longer resolve as precisely
  in editors that do not support `#strip!`, but highlighting compiles again.
- Downstream editor-specific query packs can still keep a separate `locals.scm`
  with `#strip!` for `#foo` -> `foo` normalization; do not reintroduce it in the
  shared upstream queries unless Helix gains support.
